Keyword Analysis using Python Language Processing Scripts to automate keyword findings
===

Collection of Natural Language Processing Scripts 


These are two rudimentary scripts I have created for basic keyword finding
I created these to help show Mozilla how they can start to automate keyword findings in input.mozilla.com

The WordCount.py script is Python3 that uses the map reduce function which has built in features
to deal with word lengths and other functions around characters and words. 

Then Wordcount.py script is (Python2) and more rudimentary lower level attempt at the same task so not as accurate as it is not using a pre
defined library.
